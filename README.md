🌩️ Real-Time Data Quality Validation for Streaming Data
📌 Overview
This project focuses on building a real-time data streaming pipeline for validating weather data using open-source technologies. Leveraging Apache Kafka, PySpark, and the OpenWeatherMap API, it showcases how live weather data can be collected, streamed, and processed with reliability and scalability.

🎯 Objectives
Fetch live weather data using the OpenWeatherMap API.

Set up Kafka and Zookeeper on a Windows environment.

Create a Kafka topic (weather-data) for continuous weather updates.

Develop a Kafka Producer in Python to ingest real-time data.

Build a Kafka Consumer using PySpark for real-time processing and basic validation.

🔧 Tools & Technologies
Python – Core scripting and logic.

requests – API communication.

kafka-python – Kafka integration in Python.

Apache Kafka – Distributed messaging system.

PySpark Structured Streaming – Real-time data processing.

OpenWeatherMap API – Live weather data source.

⚙️ System Architecture
1. Weather API (Data Source)
Fetches key weather attributes:

Temperature

Humidity

Pressure

Wind speed

Timestamp

2. Kafka Producer (Ingestion Layer)
Pulls data periodically from the API.

Converts it to JSON.

Sends it to a Kafka topic (weather).

3. Apache Kafka (Messaging Layer)
Acts as a buffer between producer and consumer.

Ensures high-throughput, fault-tolerant streaming.

4. Kafka Console Consumer (Debug Layer)
Enables manual inspection of streamed data for validation and debugging.

5. PySpark (Processing Layer)
Connects to Kafka.

Parses JSON to structured format.

Outputs structured data for analysis/validation.

✅ Key Benefits
Real-time anomaly detection in incoming data.

Cost-effective and open-source.

Modular and scalable for future extensions.

Sets groundwork for advanced features like validation, analytics, or visualization.

📍 Conclusion
This project successfully demonstrates a real-time data streaming architecture for weather data. Using Python, Kafka, and PySpark, it offers a foundational pipeline for future data quality enhancements, big data analytics, or integration with BI tools.
